# Chapter 1: Intro to Design Patterns


# It started with a simple SimUDuck app

This page introduces the *SimUDuck* application.   This is a silly example, like so many of those used in the Head First books, but since it forms the basis of the rest of the chapter, its important to at least suspend our disbelief and "go with it".    Try to understand the premise of what the SimUDuck application is trying to accomplish: namely, realistic simulation of a variety of kinds of ducks swimming and quacking.

# But now we need the ducks to FLY

# But something went horribly wrong...

# Joe thinks about inheritance...

# How about an interface?

# What would you do if you were Joe?

# The one constant in software development

# Zeroing in on the problem...

# Separating what changes from what stays the same

# Designing the Duck Behaviors

# Implementing the Duck Behaviors

# Integrating the Duck Behavior

# More integration...

# Testing the Duck code

# Setting behavior dynamically

# The Big Picture on encapsulated behaviors

# HAS-A can be better than IS-A

# Speaking of Design Patterns...

# Overheard at the local diner...

# Overheard in the next cubicle...

# The power of a shared pattern vocabulary

# How do I use Design Patterns?

# Tools for your Design Toolbox
