# How to submit a regrade request

If you ask questions via Piazza or email about the grading of something that was returned through Gradescope (i.e. specific homework assignment problems or exam questions), those questions <b>will not be answered</b> in that forum.

Instead you'll be referred back to Gradescope. 

# Ask on the correct problem, in a timely fashion.

Please put your regrade request ON THE SPECIFIC PROBLEM that you are asking about (Question 1, Question 2, etc.) 

ALSO: There is a deadline for regrade requests.  This is typically announced when the grades are published, and except in cases where it is not feasible (e.g. at the very end of the quarter), you'll be given one week.

Finally, you may want to review the rest of the information below before submitting your request.

# How to submit an effective regrade request

The TAs and I are happy to respond to regrade requests that are phrased politely.  We do sometimes make mistakes when grading.
 
Keep in mind the sheer numbers here.  If you multiply the number of students in your section by the number of homeworks, and the number of 
problems on each homework, you'll get a number in excess of 10,000 graded items over the course of the quarter.  So mistakes will happen.
 
Now, let's think carefully for a moment.     I want to strongly encourage you to take a deep breath and think carefully before you enter a regrade request.
 
Someday, you will be applying for internships, jobs, graduate school, etc.   You will be negotiating with people that are interviewing you, your future supervisors, etc.   People in positions of power.
 
You need to practice a skill called "diplomacy" and "managing up".   That is, you need to learn how to speak respectfully to people in positions of power when you feel there is something you need---when you need to stand up for yourself.
 
You will not be very successful if you are comabative, rude, or if you question the judgement and fairness of the individuals you are seeking help from.
 
You are in a better position if you simply ask questions that might lead the person to see things your way.
 
As an example, consider which of these ways of phrasing the same regrade request is more likely to result in a favorable outcome:
 
1. "I'm not sure why I lost points on this question.  Can you help me understand what you were looking for?  I think my answer might actually be correct, but I'm wondering if there is something that I'm missing". 
2. "Hey on question x my answer is [correct for all of these reasons] so I think I deserve full credit."
 
 
Before submitting a regrade request, look at those two examples, and decide which style you think is more appropriate, especially as you think about practicing those "professional communication skills".
 
Finally, as a reminder: we entertain regrade requests under these circumstances:
 
* Clerical error.  I simply applied the rubric incorrectly.
* You feel you have a compelling case that an item in the rubric that is marked incorrect is in fact, completely correct.
 
If you submit a regrade requests where you are questioning my judgement (or that of the TAs) (e.g. about the amount of partial credit on the rubric for a given item), please know that you are employing a very risky strategy.   Once I (or my TAs) determine a rubric for the exam, that rubric is typically not open to negotiation about matters of "judgement".     The only question is whether the rubric is correct, and has been applied consistently.
 
If there is an issue of "fact"&nbsp;e.g. if you can show me that `-foobar` is an acceptable alternative answer to `-jar` for the `javac` command,e.g. something I didn't know about, that's fine.   But if its just "I think I deserve more partial credit that you gave me", then you really should think twice before hitting the enter key.
 
I hope all of this is clear.  If you have questions, please ask.
