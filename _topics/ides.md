Opinions vary on whether, in 2016, being competent with a traditional text editor (vim or emacs) is a necessary skill.
I am firmly in the YES camp on that question.

But there is also no doubt that there comes a time to also embrace tools that can make you more productive.

The time to do that, in my view, is when you already know quite a bit about what is going on.

But when you do, you may want to try one of these IDEs:

* IntelliJ
* [Eclipse](//topics/eclipse)
* Netbeans
