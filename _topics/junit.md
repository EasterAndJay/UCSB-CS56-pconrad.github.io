JUnit is a unit testing framework for java.  It supports the practice of [Test Driven Development (TDD)](/topics/test_driven_development).

This page focuses more on JUnit as a piece of software: how to set it up, the syntax and semantics of its features, etc.

For more information on the approaches to testing in general, see the [TDD](/topics/test_driven_development) page on this site.

Several [Java Annotations](/topics/java_annotations) are used by JUnit.  Some of the most commonly used include:

* `@Before` for setup functions ([`org.junit.Before` javadoc](http://junit.sourceforge.net/javadoc/org/junit/Before.html))
* `@Test` for unit tests [`org.junit.Test` javadoc](http://junit.sourceforge.net/javadoc/org/junit/Test.html)
